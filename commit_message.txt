Fix(parseArgs): Preserve backslash in double quotes for non-special chars

- In double quotes, a backslash is now preserved if it precedes a character that is not `"` or `\`.
- This aligns with standard shell behavior where `"\a"` is interpreted as `\a` (literal backslash) rather than just `a`.
- Fixes issues where file paths containing backslashes were incorrectly parsed when double-quoted.
